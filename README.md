# AtCoder Contest Solutions (C & C++)

Welcome! 🚀

This repository contains my **C** and **C++** solutions for various **AtCoder programming contests**, including:
- AtCoder Beginner Contests (ABC)
- AtCoder Regular Contests (ARC)
- AtCoder Grand Contests (AGC)

I aim to document my coding journey, improve my problem-solving skills, and share clean, structured solutions with the community.

## 📜 About My Programming Contest Journey

I started my programming contest journey on **March 11, 2022**, through a special training program organized by the **Homna Robotics and Programming Club**.  
This initiative was led and mentored by:
- **Zayan Tarek** (Trainer)
- **Khaled Ahmed Raju** (Trainer)

This entire program was proudly supported and produced by our **Homna Upazila UNO Sir, Romon Dey**.  
It laid the foundation of my passion for problem-solving, algorithm design, and competitive programming.
